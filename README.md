## About Laraconf 11

This repo is forked from [iAmKevinMcKee/laraconf](https://github.com/iAmKevinMcKee/laraconf)
and manually updated to Laravel 11 mainly as a learning challenge. I was following along
with the Laracasts tutorial at [Rapid Laravel Apps With Filament](https://laracasts.com/series/rapid-laravel-development-with-filament/) (paywalled) but after Episode 5 I could not
get the project to work so I figured I may as well fork the completed Laravel 10 project and see if I could convert it to Laravel 11. With a lot of help from Claude/Cline I managed to
get it most of it running and will keep pushing updates as I finished the tutorial.

## Usage

I will try to keep this section update and tested.

```
cd ~/Dev # or wherever you develop projects in your home directory
git clone https://github.com/markc/laraconf11.git
cd laraconf11
cp .env.example .env # update DB_* entries, default to sqlite
composer install
npm install
# more to come as I actually test a Github clone
```
